# Building an Artificial Neural Network for Advertisement Click Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and analyzing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether users will click on an online advertisement. By analyzing features like daily time spent on the site, user demographics, and browsing behavior, the model aims to understand patterns influencing users' ad clicking behavior.

- Model building
- Model training and evaluation
- Analysis of model performance
- Conclusions and further improvements

## Objective
The primary objective is to use neural networks to predict user behavior regarding ad clicking accurately. This involves training an ANN with high precision and recall to minimize false positives and false negatives.

## Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Ensure Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook cell by cell to replicate the model training and evaluation process.

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 0.77 - Indicates the percentage of total predictions our model got right.
- **Precision**: 0.911 - Indicates the correctness achieved in positive prediction.
- **Recall**: 0.6486 - Reflects the ability of the model to find all relevant cases (all potential clicks).
- **F1 Score**: 0.7508 - Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
- **ROC AUC Score**: 0.8901 - Represents the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes.

## Analysis and Insights
The ANN model showed promising results with an accuracy of 77% and an ROC AUC score of 0.89, suggesting good discriminatory ability. However, the recall of 64.86% points towards the potential for improving the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of clicks. The high precision score indicates a low false positive rate, which is crucial for not wasting resources on uninterested users.

## Conclusions and Future Work
The ANN performed well but could benefit from further tuning and experimentation with:
- More epochs for training to see if the model improves with additional learning iterations.
- Advanced techniques like dropout or more sophisticated layers to improve generalization.
- Exploring more about feature engineering and the addition of interaction terms that might improve model performance.

## Steps to Run the Model
1. Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Build the neural network architecture using Keras.
4. Compile and train the model on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model on the testing set using various metrics.
